# Case Study â€” Data Science Lifecycle

This case study demonstrates the **complete lifecycle of a data science project**:
from problem definition and data exploration to preprocessing, modeling, evaluation,
and drawing conclusions.  

## Contents
- Problem definition
- Data loading (Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn`)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing & Pipelines (scaling, transformations)
- Train/Test split + Cross-validation
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, ROC/PR curves, classification report)
- Conclusion & key takeaways

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`notebook.ipynb`).
2. Run all cells top-to-bottom.
3. Each section is labeled (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation).

## Educational Purpose
This case study was prepared as part of the **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis** exam.  
It illustrates the end-to-end workflow of building and evaluating a data science system
and can be used as a reference for similar projects.
